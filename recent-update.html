        <p>CryptoSpot is an app with a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies (not including stablecoins) with live price updates.  
          The user-interface design was inspired by SundaeSwap.com.  I used HTML, CSS, and 
          Vanilla JavaScript to build this project.  
        </p>

        <h3>Issues and how I solved them</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The first problem was getting the background color to have 2 linear gradients.  One from left to right, and 
            another from bottom to top.  I quickly realized with CSS only 1 of them would work due to specificity, so I put them together 
            into the same selector.  It still did not work until I switched the 2 gradients, I put the first one at the bottom and 
            the one at the bottom I put on top, in the style sheet.  Just like that, it worked.  I believe it was because one of the gradients 
            has an alpha channel below 1, so it needed to be on the top within the style sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tuesday, January 25: The first round of ISO rewards will be calculated. ISO participants must delegate 
            ADA to qualifying ISO Scoopers prior to 21:45 UTC on January 25th to be able to earn SUNDAE for all five 
            ISO rounds. See below for more details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thursday, January 20: Yield farming SUNDAE rewards begin. Yield farming will be available for at least 
            the first six months of the SundaeSwap DEX, and during this period, LP tokens staked to yield farming 
            contracts in eligible pools can earn additional SUNDAE rewards. See below for more details.
