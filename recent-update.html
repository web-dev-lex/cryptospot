        <p>CryptoSpot is an app with a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies (not including stablecoins) with live price updates.  
          The user-interface design was inspired by SundaeSwap.com.  I used HTML, CSS, and 
          Vanilla JavaScript to build this project.  
        </p>

        <h3>Issues and how I solved them</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The first problem was getting the background color to have 2 linear gradients.  One from left to right, and 
            another from bottom to top.  I quickly realized with CSS only 1 of them would work due to specificity, so I put them together 
            into the same selector.  It still did not work until I switched the 2 gradients, I put the first one at the bottom and 
            the one at the bottom I put on top, in the style sheet.  Just like that, it worked.  I believe it was because one of the gradients 
            has an alpha channel below 1, so it needed to be on the top within the style sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another issue was making the app page responsive.  I had the containers built in a way I couldn't use flex wrap 
            and I did not want to change the format of it.  So I went with hiding the other elements as the screen gets smaller 
            until there is the name of the coin and the price of it left.
          </li>
          <li>
            The final problem was the most difficult, I had to use javascript to make the drop down box when the info button 
            is clicked.  I was able to make the box and paragraph appear with appending it within a function, but I could not 
            remove the paragraph when the box disappeared.  I figured out I needed a truthy/falsey values to get the box and 
            paragraph to appear and disappear on each click.  So I set a variable to true, then each time the button is clicked, 
            the value is changed to false, and vice versa.  This allows me to use an if...else statement to show and hide the box 
            and paragraph on each click. 
          </li>
        </ul>
